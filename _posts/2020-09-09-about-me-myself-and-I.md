Hi everyone! my name is **_Taylor Chambers_** and I am a junior at _Christopher Newport University,_ I am 20 years old and my preferred pronouns are **she/her.**

After college I want to move to **Nashville, Tennessee** and become a social media marketing manager for literally any big name company, which is why I took interest in this course. I am majoring in English with a double minor in Communications and Business Administration, so while I am not minoring in Digital Humanities, I believe this class would be beneficial to my understanding of social media and how to work in an online environment.

Growing up, I wanted to be an author or an editior - I love reading. However I quickly realized that I live a more expensive lifestyle and the [salary of an author](https://www.ziprecruiter.com/Salaries/Writer-Author-Salary) probably would not suffice. Then, I was introduced to the world of social media and media influencers and I found my passion, and so I am here. Additionally, I have an innate love for writing and feel like taking classes out of my comfort zone, like a class for the Digital Humanities, will help me become the best writer I can become.

In my free time, which is sparing, I like to volunteer or find ways to educate myself. Being involved in social movements, visiting museums or pop up events, traveling, or finding local non profits to help out is was makes life worth living for me. This past summer in quarantine I tried to do as much of that as I could, socially distanced of course. But, I was involved in a few internships - one that led to a job, and I spent alot of time doing work for my sorority Alpha Phi. When I could though, I made sure to go on a ton of adventures with my best friend Cub. We went to waterfalls, played xbox, and visited Clifton, VA a lot.

A little bit about me as a person! I chose the name of this blog to be "blog with grace," because my favorite quote is "smile with grace, even if your heart is aching." I think the phrase 'blog with grace' encourages me to empty out my thoughts here, be transparent, but keep a professional and collected appearance. 
  I have one dog named Trigger, she is a german shepard mix, and three cows in Upstate New York named _Caramel, Velvet, and Dixie._ I was born and raised in **Georgia,** but because my father was military we moved around quite a bit. **Currently home is Fairfax, VA - about 20 minutes from Washington D.c.** Some fandoms I belong to include One Direction, Criminal Minds - specifically Matthew Grey Gubler - and The Vampire Diaries. My favorite social media platforms are Tik Tok and Twitter, and my favorite netflix shows are Greys Anatomy and Criminal Minds.
