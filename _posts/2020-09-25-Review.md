  The use of gender has changed over the centuries, not only in our culture, but also in its role in our literature. This project is directing its research at novels written by authors as famous as Jane Austen and others that are much more obscure. By looking at the history of literature and books, the creators of this project hope to be able to study the ever changing view on gender by writers in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The goal is that by embarking on this mission, they are able to draw on the views and opinions of the past to diagnose potential causes, solutions, and sources of gender-based discrimination and stereotyping. Through their studies, they have asked questions and performed comparisons such as examining passive and active voice, pronoun frequencies, and much more.
    
  The team involved in this project included many students and was directed by Michael Scott Cuthbert. The team consisted of web acquisition specialists, data sanitation engineers, gender studies specialists, visualization specialists, and statistic specialists along with many other roles that were imperative to the creation of this project. Something I really appreciated about this team was the wide range of backgrounds and cultures included. One part about the project was allowing team members to choose certain books they wanted in the analysis. This along with the diversity in the team essentially allowed the analysis to incorporate a wider range of literature and writing styles.  

**Gendered Pronoun Frequency Analysis**

  One of my favorite aspects of this project was the use of the Dunning Log-Likelihood statistical model to calculate how distinct a word is in its own corpus. This study found that female authors were significantly more likely to use feminine pronouns in their writing than males - indicating that female authors value the importance of having influential female characters in their novels. Adding to this, female authors were also more likely to use male pronouns like “Mr.” and “sir” more frequently than male authors as well, demonstrating how females addressed males during this time.

**Pronoun Adjective Usage**

One of the most interesting aspects of this project is the study of the evolution of pronoun adjective use. The team obtained these statistics  by calculating the difference between adjective associations with male pronouns, and with female pronouns. “Number of male pronoun associations – number of female pronoun associations = difference value. Adjectives with the highest positive difference values demonstrate the strongest male pronoun association, and adjectives with the highest negative difference values demonstrate the strongest female pronoun association” (Gender Novels, Analysis). I found this very interesting because it allows the gender roles from this time period to be a tangible source of data, and allows the team and its readers to utilize this information to reflect on current day gender norms in literature and in everyday life. 

  Something I would have enjoyed seeing in this project is a stronger motive. In its current form it is just raw statistics, however I think because of its factual research and reputable platform, MIT could have utilized this research and project to encourage its audience to understand gender norms as they exist today, and how to avoid biases in writing. Additionally, I would have found it interesting if they went on to compare the statistics from 1770-1922 to modern day novels to see if the appearance of gender norms in literature has evolved at all. 
  While this project was created by a Digital Humanities Lab, its research and studies could be very applicable to many other fields. The fields of English, Communications, Gender Studies, and Sociology have been studying very similar topics and this type of statistical and visual research could help develop similar claims surrounding the concept of gender norms.  Additionally, I found it interesting that the project does not reference any need for additional funding, and plans for further research, or any awards received. It does however, do an exceptional job of citing the sources used, and the coding that was adopted from this project.
