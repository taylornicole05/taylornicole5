Ernest Hemingway is one of the most renowned writers in literary history, but had also created his reputation as a romantic. Ernest Miller Hemingway was an American journalist, novelist, short-story writer, and sportsman. His economical and understated style—which he termed the iceberg theory—had a strong influence on 20th-century fiction, while his adventurous lifestyle and his public image brought him admiration from later generations.

**Research**

Overall the research has been going really well. I have found a community of people that are just as intrigued by Ernest Hemingway as myself, and finding these communities has helped me formulate my own ideas and construct my research. I learned that over the course of his life, Hemingway wrote more than 6,000 letters, postcards, and telegrams; 85% of them have remained unpublished, held by private collectors and in archives. This genuinely fueled my excitement for this project as it introduced me to so many different avenues I can utilize in my project. 


I am pleasantly surprised at the amount of content from or about Hemingway I have been able to find. There is so much more to him as a person than his poetry or novels, and as a fan of his it has been very enlightening to read and research relationships, success, and troubles he faced. With this information, it has been much easier to formulate a solid and educational project, and had opened up multiple avenues that I can take to differentiate my project from others. 


My next phase of research will focus on the audio component of my project. Who has utilized this tool? How did they make it happen? What did the end product sound like? Was it realistic? These are all questions I look forward to answering throughout the rest of my research. From some of the preliminary research I have conducted regarding digital humanities projects featuring audio elements, this will absorb most of the funding from my grant. This is because in order to achieve the most realistic and successful end product, proper allocation of finances is not just necessary, but required.

**Comparisons To Other Projects**

Pennsylvania State University has created the Hemingway Letters Project. This project is bringing these letters together, offering an intimate look at Hemingway’s life through a 17-volume collection of his correspondence. This project is an inspiration for the work I am pursuing. While I admire Hemingway's letters in their entirety, adding the audio component not only separates our project, but creates a more intimate relationship between the late Hemingway and his readers. 


My project differs in the sense that it adds texture to the Hemingway letters. It places its listeners right in Hemingways hands. It brings Hemingway's literature beyond the literary world. What separates this project is that because the letters will be part of a digital audible edition, they are truly open-access, easily downloadable by users of the edition, and appeal to a wider audience, as opposed to a scholarly, creative exercise.

**Reflections**

Honestly I see it in a more passionate light than I had previously. It’s exciting to see a community of individuals that support and study Hemingway. My goal for this project is to explore the relationship we have with Hemingway and his work. Hemingway is a perfect subject because when we interact with his literature, we are inspired not only by his writing and his life, but also his myth. All of these qualities make Hemingway, and the people who love him, an interesting subject. This digital humanities opportunity gives me a chance to explore Hemingway, and allow him to have an impact on his fans, person to person.


As I mentioned before, I have found so many other resources I can utilize for this project. My overall goal was to create a digital humanities project that will foster an intimate relationship between Hemingway and his fans. However, I now have found many other ways to create not only a relationship, but a bond between the two parties. Additionally I have had to learn to control my content. This has come with self awareness, but essentially making sure what I am researching along with what I am writing and creating is relevant and adds to the project - rather than creating loose ends. 


Somethings I have had to learn throughout this process though is self awareness and content control. As someone who is also passionate about Hemingway, it is easy for me to go down this rabbit hole of research - or even to create my own while writing my Environmental Scan or my narrative. I have had to learn how to be aware of my research, writing, and topics to ensure that they all can assist in creating a cohesive final product, with little to no stray variables or outliers.
