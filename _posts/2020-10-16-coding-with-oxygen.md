**Introduction**
Digital Humanities is a topic I had little to no experience in prior to taking Dr. Stovers class, and coding was something I could not fathom being a part of my academic experience. However, combining an interesting essay with a subject I was not familiar with, ended up being something I excelled at and allowed me to create a project that I am nothing less than proud of. Additionally, I found it entertaining and important to document the monumental moments of this project through my DH twitter account, which you will see throughout this post. The moments consisted of summaries of the reading, documenting markup, utilizing oxygen, user error, and my overall views of Oxygen. 

_"The Yellow Wallpaper"_, by Charlotte Perkins Stetson, was a very interesting yet complex story to read, but incorporating the use of Oxygen into this project allowed me to understand each line at a more in depth level. My section of the story is centered around the narrator hiding in a room while John attempts to get in. The eerie tone of this section allows the reader to get a sense that the narrator is beginning to spiral into insanity. This is seen through the dialogue within the writing, and was interesting to code into Oxygen.

**Transcription**
As a class, we were all assigned different sections of the periodical edition of Charlotte Perkins Stetson’s “The Yellow Wall-paper”. Once everyone transcribed and coded their individual sections, it would all be put together as one final product. I was assigned the second column of page 656 of the reading. This is the final section of the reading, and encapsulates the narrator's final demise into insanity.

We began the project by marking up our individual Google docs with page beginnings, quotes, em dashes, page endings, and more to help us understand where the code needed to be inserted. Some students had trouble with this aspect of the project. However I felt that once I took a step back and viewed markup from a more simplistic perspective, transcription became a much easier and basic process. This aspect can be redundant, having to cross reference the text with the transcription and carefully placing your markup, but once you view the final product in Oxygen the entire process becomes worthwhile.

**Oxygen**
Using Oxygen was a surprising experience. I did not expect to like it - coding had always been something that intimidated me. But, I actually found coding through Oxygen to be therapeutic, relaxing, and validating (thanks little green box in the right corner). I had a user error experience at first, as I spent hours working on my code and neglected to save it. I came back to continue working on it a few days later and my computer crashed while I was trying to save the finished product - bummer. The second time around however, I had a good understanding of what I was doing and was able to get through it fairly quickly in comparison to the first go around. This experience with user error taught me a major lesson in the world of coding regarding saving my work, valuing my time, and introduced me to how cathartic coding can be once you get a handle of it.

Prior to using Oxygen, I was fairly intimidated by the concept of coding - and feared I would not do well. However, I found various tricks that helped me through the process. One of these being that I would insert multiple paragraph tags ('''<p><p/>''') at once, and essentially fill in those blanks, and then delete any extras. This just made the code aspect less intimidating, and paired with the little green box, helped me stay on track and assured me I was entering everything correctly. Additionally, I followed the recording that Dr. Stover uploaded on numerous occasions. I felt that this was the most helpful strategy for me, because it allowed me to hear every step as well as visualize how the assignment should appear in Oxygen. Lastly, because coding can so easily unravel into a mess, I found that communication is an imperative part of this process. Asking my classmates for clarification, communicating with Dr. Stover, and doing additional research on Oxygen were all important uses of communication that assured me I was doing the correct thing.

**Conclusion** 
Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this project. I found the reading to be complex, interesting, and mentally stimulating. The actual process of coding, believe it or not, was my favorite aspect. There was something so validating about finishing this project, viewing it in the author setting, and knowing that you did everything correctly. Digital Humanities and coding are topics that I had never encountered until this semester, and are topics that I am still not incredibly confident in. But, this assignment pushed me out of my comfort zone, and introduced me to a skill I was not aware I had. I am very thankful for the opportunity to take part in this project, and I am excited to pursue additional DH research and coding projects in the future.
