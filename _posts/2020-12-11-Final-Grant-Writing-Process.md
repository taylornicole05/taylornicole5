Title: My Digital Humanities Project, It's Progress, and How I View Grant Writing As A Whole.
---


I enrolled in this course under the impression that it was a social media centered class. Reflecting on this past semester there are three things I can take away from this. 1. I clearly had no idea what the digital humanities were prior to this class, 2. I obviously have little to no experience reading course objectives, and 3. Throughout the process of virtual learning and attending college during a pandemic, this class is one of the only courses I can genuinely say I learned a lot from. This course and Dr. Stover opened my eyes immensely to the topic of digital humanities, the process of coding, grant writing, and so much more. 

What Have I Changed?

One piece of feedback I received from my previous blog and peer reviews, is to watch my bias as a Hemingway fan. After reading through my work, I can now see how I have veered off of an unbiased path to showing my personal appreciation for Ernest Hemingway. This has played a huge factor in my editing process - making sure that I am writing more from an educational perspective and providing beneficial information to my audience rather than emphasizing my own interest. 
 
Along with writing from an unbiased perspective, I have also been working to write more about the educational benefits of studying Ernest Hemingway through this style of a Digital Humanities. Through studying Hemingway so intensely, we not only learn about him as a person but we uncover a lot of information about this history of when he lived as well. This can be beneficial to the studies of history, psychology, and love in general. It is very clear that life has changed immensely since Hemingway's time, but studying his interactions, relationships, and everyday life can provide valuable insight and information about how humans have evolved. 
 
How Has My Project Progressed?
 
It has been really interesting, especially in the last few weeks, seeing my grant finally come together. Finishing the budget was eye opening to me because I realized I was almost done, and this project that started with just an idea is now coming to fruition. Researching the different softwares to use, how much the cost, and many other aspects of the finishing touches was really interesting and taught me a lot about how much goes into the actual process of writing a grant. 
Additionally, I organized my resume, to the best of my ability, to reflect a digital humanities resume to support my grant. This was really interesting to me because I come from a standard job application background, and this was the first time I was able to create a resume that had intention, and that supported my end goal. However, because I do not have a history in the Digital Humanities field, my resume does not appear as relevant as it could.
 
 
How Do I View The Grant Process?
 
I have a much greater understanding and overall appreciation for those individuals who pursue grant publishing, or build digital humanities projects. When we were first assigned this project, I genuinely thought it would be a simple, easy, and quick process. However, this process is essentially a full time job if you were pursuing it as an actual proposal. While the hours of researching one topic can be exhausting, I can wholeheartedly say that finishing the project and seeing all of your hard work in front of you is such a rewarding moment.

The process of writing a DH project and a grant proposal is very tedious, specific, and time consuming. But, it is also very rewarding and telling of an individual's passions, interests, and motivations. I admire those individuals who have dedicated their time to writing a grant proposal, regardless of whether it was accepted or not - this process is a clear indication of someone who is dedicated, passionate, and driven regarding a certain topic or cause, and anyone who dedicates this much time towards a project is more than deserving of that recognition.

I discussed in some of my tweets how this class is not what I expected it to be, and that is the truth. However through this course and its assignments this class has proven to have been so beneficial. I have learned that if you are studying or creating something you enjoy or that excites you, it is almost not considered working at all. While my grants project will not be physically created, I am excited to see what the world of digital humanities has in store for Ernest Hemingway in the future and if a project similar to mine will be created one day.
